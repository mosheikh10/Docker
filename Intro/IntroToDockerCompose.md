# Introduction to Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** helps you run multiple Docker containers together as a single application.

## Key Features
- **Docker-compose.yml file**  
  Defines services, networks, and volumes in a YAML configuration file.
- **Commands**  
  Provides CLI commands to manage multi-container applications (e.g., `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`).
- **Networking**  
  Automatically creates a network for containers to communicate with each other.
